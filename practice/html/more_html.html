<p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with <a href="http://xkcd.com"><em>tomatoes</em></a>, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is eaten with knife and fork[citation needed], but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Small pizzas are sometimes called pizzettas.</p>
