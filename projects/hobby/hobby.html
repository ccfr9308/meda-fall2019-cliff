    <p id="first">My name is Cliff Reilly and I'm a 31 year old conductor of choral and instrumental music.  I studied at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Music.  During my time there I was a student assistant conductor for the college a cappella group, the college chapel choir, and the college handbell ensemble.  Since then I have graduated and joined numerous ensembles around the Bay Area..</p>

    <p>Conducting is the art of expression through music.  Various time signatures present themselves on a page, and as a conductor you are expected to create beat patterns with your arms to make the music flow.  You are also expected to give cues to various sections and instruments in order to create acoustically pleasing sounds, or at least interesting sounds that make an audience feel a certain way.  The art of conducting is a performance and should be treated as such.</p>

    <p>For further resources and reading feel free to check out the Wikipedia article on Conducting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting">here.</a>  I recommend purchasing "The Grammar of Conducting" by Max Rudolf as a study guide.  The easiest way to begin conducting is by forming a group with which to make music.  Remember: as a conductor, you are the one responsible for the sounds that your ensemble produces.</p>
