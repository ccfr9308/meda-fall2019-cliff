Colors for website:
Background: Red

Red and Gold are 49ers colors (my favorite team) and the link color differentiates heavily from those to underscore the different links.

ABOUT ME
Cliff Reilly is an American composer and conductor.  He started with handbells at the age of 8 and quickly grew into an accomplished musician while studying with the Bay Bells Handbell Ensemble, Bell Appeal, and private study.  He conducted his first piece at the age of 14 with the Peninsula Girls Chorus.  He graduated from International High School in San Francisco with a higher level in music.

Since then Cliff has transitioned into the choral world after studying at the prestigious Walden School for creative composers, and graduated in 2011 with a degree in music from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania.  Cliff has been a member of numerous a cappella groups from small to large sizes and has written over 20 arrangements for these groups.  He currently resides in San Francisco, CA with his wife and two dogs.  In his spare time he enjoys reading, website design and beer.
